## News:

* [LGoodDatePicker 11.2.0](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on February 28, 2021. This version adds the Icelandic language translation and the possibility to customize the colors of date and time pickers in disabled state. This is the last version that will still support the older Java versions, Java 6 or 7. Future releases will require Java 8 or higher.

* [LGoodDatePicker 11.1.0](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on September 30, 2020. This version adds the possibility to customize the colors used for the mouse hover highlight of the calendar panel labels.

* [LGoodDatePicker 11.0.0](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on August 10, 2020. This version adds a feature for optionally setting a user supplied clock, using 'DatePickerSettings.setClock()'. This can be useful in some simulation environments, when the developer may not want to use the real system time. The build infrastructure was improved to simplify the process of adding new releases to Maven Central. Some minor bugs were fixed, including an issue with using certain types of date formats.

* [LGoodDatePicker 10.4.1](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on June 22, 2018. This version fixes a few minor issues and bugs, and adds a new function DatePickerSettings.setDefaultYearMonth().

* [LGoodDatePicker 10.3.1](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on July 5, 2017. This version adds listener notifications for changes to the YearMonth, and adds the colors for the selected date to the customizable colors in the DatePickerSettings. The pom file was enhanced to allow developers to optionally build the project from source, without first installing the GPG signing tools. This release was added to the [Release Section](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases), [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7CLGoodDatePicker), and [LGoodDatePicker Backports](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases/tag/Backports).

* [LGoodDatePicker 10.2.3](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on May 8, 2017. This version fixes a MacOSX related bug, adds the Norwegian language translation, and adds the option to customize any used font or component color. 

* [LGoodDatePicker 8.2.0](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on November 29, 2016. This version fixes a critical Linux related bug, adds the Bulgarian language translation, and adds to the optional visual customization capabilities. 

* [LGoodDatePicker 7.6.3](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was added [to Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7CLGoodDatePicker).

* [LGoodDatePicker 7.5.1](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on June 30, 2016. This release adds support to the library for JTable editors, and JavaBeans data binding.

* The [LGoodDatePicker Backports](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases/tag/Backports) were released on May 4, 2016. With these backports, the library can now be used in projects which are built for older Java versions, Java 6 or 7. 

* [LGoodDatePicker 5.2.2](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released April 25, 2016. This release adds the CalendarPanel component to the library. This component allows the programmer to (optionally) use the calendar panel controls independently from the DatePicker component. An example for the independent calendar panel was also added to the [demo program](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases).

* [LGoodDatePicker 4.3.1](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released March 17, 2016. The requirements for publishing to the Maven Central repository were added to the project. (Including jar signing, global package name conventions, Pom file specifications, etc.). The project now has an entry [at Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7CLGoodDatePicker). This makes the library easier to include in applications that use Apache Maven.
