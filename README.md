This version fixes a critical Linux related bug, adds the Bulgarian language translation, and adds to the optional visual customization capabilities.  This release was added to the [Release Section](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases), [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22LGoodDatePicker%22), and [LGoodDatePicker Backports](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases/tag/Backports).

* [LGoodDatePicker 7.6.3](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was added [to Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22LGoodDatePicker%22).

* [LGoodDatePicker 7.5.1](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released on June 30, 2016. This release adds support to the library for JTable editors, and JavaBeans data binding.

* The [LGoodDatePicker Backports](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases/tag/Backports) were released on May 4, 2016. With these backports, the library can now be used in projects which are built for older Java versions, Java 6 or 7. 

* [LGoodDatePicker 5.2.2](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released April 25, 2016. This release adds the CalendarPanel component to the library.

An example for the independent calendar panel was also added to the [demo program](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases).

* [LGoodDatePicker 4.3.1](https://github.com/LGoodDatePicker/LGoodDatePicker/releases) was released March 17, 2016. The requirements for publishing to the Maven Central repository were added to the project. (Including jar signing, global package name conventions, Pom file specifications, etc.). The project now has an entry [at Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22LGoodDatePicker%22). This makes the library easier to include in applications that use Apache Maven.
