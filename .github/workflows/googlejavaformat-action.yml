##### Notes #####

### Used action repository:
# The original action repository is here. (The master version.):
# Link: https://github.com/axel-op/googlejavaformat-action
# Original action line:  - uses: axel-op/googlejavaformat-action@v3
#
# However, we are using our own fork of this action. 
# Action line for our fork:  - uses: LGoodDatePicker/googlejavaformat-action@v3

### Reason for using a fork:
# The advantage of having our own fork of this action is that if the "axel-op" repository is
# ever broken, then that break will not automatically break our own code. 
# (Because we are not directly using the "axel-op" repository in our workflow.)

### How to update our forked action repository:
# Our fork of the action repository will only be updated when we manually click the update 
# button in the LGoodDatePicker/googlejavaformat-action repository. 
# The update button is named "Fetch Upstream". Clicking this button will update the fork to
# the latest version of the action. 

### We only use a 'push' trigger, and not a 'pull_request' trigger. 
# Reason: From testing, it appears that when a 'pull_request' trigger is used, it causes the 
# format action to fail during any pull request that originates from any forked repository. 
# This change fixes issues discussed in the pull requests listed below.
# Pull requests, #152, #156, #158, #159, #160, #161, #163, #164.
