/**
 * Describes an object that can localize Strings accessible via a key.
 *
 * <p>This interface is used by the JGoodies Forms to localize Strings from ResourceBundles and
 * ResourceMaps (a class from JGoodies Application). The latter implements this StringLocalizer
 * interface. Since ResourceBundle does not implement this interface, a wrapper can be used that
 * implements this interface and just delegates to the ResourceBundle to look up the localized
 * String.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This class is not part of the public JGoodies Common API. It's intended
 * for implementation purposes only. The class's API may change at any time.
