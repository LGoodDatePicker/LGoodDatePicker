/**
 * MouseLiberalAdapter.
 *
 * <p>This class extends the MouseAdapter class, to include two additional events. The added events
 * are the mouseLiberalClick() and the mouseLiberalDoubleClick(). By default, the mouseClick() event
 * in the MouseAdapter has a limitation. The mouseClick() event cannot register a click if the mouse
 * pointer moves even slightly, between the mouse press and mouse release events. By contrast, the
 * mouseLiberalClick() will register a "liberal mouse click" even if the mouse moves (by any amount)
 * during the click event, as long as the mouse pointer does not leave the boundaries of the
 * component which is generating the mouse events. (This "liberal mouse click" behavior duplicates
 * the "actionPerformed()" functionality that exists in the JButton class.)
 *
 * <p>Note: This class is frequently used to detect clicks in a JLabel, but it can be used in any
 * swing component that will accept a MouseAdapter.
 *
 * <p>Using this class is similar to using the MouseAdapter class. (See also: The MouseAdapter
 * javadocs.) To use this class, you would extend this class and override any (non-final) event
 * methods that are of interest.
 *
 * <p>The original MouseAdapter functions have been marked as final, and cannot be overridden.
 * However, the class still provides all the original functions (with slightly modified function
 * names). The two new functions are also provided: mouseLiberalClick() and
 * mouseLiberalDoubleClick(). A usage example is shown below.
 *
 * <p>Usage example: <code>
 * JLabel labelSingleClick = new JLabel("Single click me.");
 * JLabel labelDoubleClick = new JLabel("Double click me.");
 * labelSingleClick.addMouseListener(new MouseLiberalAdapter() {
 *
 * public void mouseLiberalClick(MouseEvent e) {
 * JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Single click detected.");
 * }
 * });
 * labelDoubleClick.addMouseListener(new MouseLiberalAdapter() {
 *
 * public void mouseLiberalDoubleClick(MouseEvent e) {
 * JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Double click detected.");
 * }
 * });
 * </code>
