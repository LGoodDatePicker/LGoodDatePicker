/**
 * CalendarBorderProperties,
 *
 * <p>This class is used to specify properties of the border labels in the calendar panel. This
 * class can be used to change border colors, or border thicknesses (in pixels), or both. A single
 * border label or a group of border labels can be changed at the same time. The border labels are
 * individually identified using a "border coordinate system", which is described below.
 *
 * <p>The borders in the calendar panel are implemented with colored labels. (Instances of JLabel).
 * Each border label is assigned a two-dimensional border label coordinate. Below is a visual
 * representation of all the border label coordinates. The character 'X' represents a coordinate
 * with a border label, and the character 'o' represents a coordinate that does not have a border
 * label (is empty).
 *
 * <pre>
 * ~12345
 * 1XXXXX
 * 2XoXoX
 * 3XXXXX
 * 4XoXoX
 * 5XXXXX
 * </pre>
 *
 * For example: Row 1 of the border coordinate system contains the topmost border in the calendar
 * panel. (The horizontal border above the weekday labels. This border is invisible by default.)
 * Column 5 contains the rightmost possible border, which is the vertical border to the right of the
 * calendar dates.
 *
 * <p>Note that the border labels at "corner" or "intersection" coordinates can be visually very
 * small, as small as 1x1 pixel. Also note that there is no border label at the following four
 * border label coordinates: ((2,2) (4,2) (2,4) (4,4)). Including these coordinates in your
 * specified range is acceptable and normal, but will have no effect on the empty spaces.
 *
 * <p>Technical note: The border label coordinates do not refer to date labels, (or layout cells, or
 * screen coordinates). They refer only to the array indexes of the JLabel elements, in the
 * two-dimensional "borderLabels" array inside the CalendarPanel class.
